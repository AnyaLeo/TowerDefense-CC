# CodingClass-TowerDefense
 A repository that holds code for a Unity class for middle school students
 
 **Unity version**: Unity 2020.3.29f1
 
You should probably be okay if you want to use this code with a higher version of Unity. If you use the code with a lower version of Unity, there is a high chance the code will break (but you can still try it, just try it way ahead of class so you can download a correct version of Unity if it fails).
